# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier

**Convolutional Neural Networks** (CNNs) are specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images. CNNs use convolutional layers to detect spatial hierarchies, making them ideal for computer vision tasks.

**Handwritten Digit Classifier**: Train an FNN on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits.
